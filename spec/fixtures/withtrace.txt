this is a file with a stacktrace in it

/home/smash/samples/tracer/otherdir/file2.rb:6:in `block in outerfunction': whoops (RuntimeError)
  from /home/smash/samples/tracer/dir/file1.rb:3:in `innerfunction'
  from /home/smash/samples/tracer/otherdir/file2.rb:5:in `outerfunction'
  from /home/smash/samples/tracer/entry.rb:7:in `toplevel'
  from /home/smash/samples/tracer/entry.rb:10:in `<main>'

so i can test from-selection stuff
